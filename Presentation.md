# Problem to solve : 
- Having a handy tool that may help in day-to-day tasks by providing ability to 
	capture/edit/annotate images.
	record screen and video using webcam.
	have real time conferencing capability to collaborate better.
- All this in a 'easy' to use tool.

# Use cases (target audience)
- Graphic designers, product managers, technical writers who gather requirements and almost anyone else who works in an office.
- QA engineers, able to capture the expected vs actual behaviour.
- Teachers, presentators and tutors present everywhere.
- End-to-end customer support executives.
- To hold meetings remotely across the globe.
- Have all this available from any device from anywhere.

# Solutions available :
- Tiny take (for screen and video capture) --> Sadly, works only on _Windows_.
- Some awesome iApp-iShare app available on Mac-iOS --> Again, sadly works on _MAC_.
- Some really cool and fantastic app developed on Android --> Oh come'on! Who works on an android phone? I need lives for candyCrush or temple run, that's what an android is for! 
		Jokes apart, people don't use phones for work unless they are not in office and as a last resort.
